                    Az 1. szinten elk√©sz√≠thetsz egy t√∂rt√©netet egy m√°sik f≈ëszerepl≈ëvel, amelyet te magad adsz meg.

                    Az els≈ë sorba √≠rt `{ask}` bek√©ri a t√∂rt√©net f≈ëszerepl≈ëj√©nek a nev√©t.

                    Az els≈ë sor ut√°n kezdd a `{print}` utas√≠t√°ssal, ha a mondatot ki kell √≠ratni.
                    Akkor haszn√°ld az `{echo}` parancsot, ha azt szeretn√©d, hogy f≈ëszerepl≈ë neve a mondat v√©g√©n legyen.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} A t√∂rt√©net f≈ëszerepl≈ëje
                    {print} A f≈ëszerepl≈ë most az erd≈ëben fog s√©t√°lni
                    {echo} Kicsit f√©l, szeg√©ny
                    {print} ≈êr√ºlt zajokat hall minden√ºtt
                    {print} F√©l, hogy ez egy k√≠s√©rtet-j√°rta erd≈ë

                    A 2. szinten sz√≥rakoztat√≥bb√° teheted a t√∂rt√©netedet. F≈ë karaktered neve mostant√≥l
                    b√°rhol lehet a mondatban.

                    Ehhez egy kicsit fel kell jav√≠tanod a k√≥dodat. Most el≈ësz√∂r el kell nevezned a f≈ëszerepl≈ëdet. Olyan nevet v√°lassz, amely nem tartalmaz √©kezetes bet≈±t.

                    Ezt a nevet b√°rhol elhelyezheted a mondatban.

                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.

                story_text: |
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. Hozz√°adhatsz valami v√©letlenszer≈±t is a t√∂rt√©net√©hez. B√°rmilyen sz√∂rnyet, √°llatot vagy m√°s akad√°lyt.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    allatok is bagoly, s√ºndiszn√≥, tatu
                    print Most hallja a allatok at random hangj√°t
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story. For example
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} They hear a sound
                    animals {is} üêø, ü¶î, ü¶á, ü¶â
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code and finish it by adding quotation marks on the blanks in lines 1 and 2.
                    The blanks in line 3 and 4 should not be replaced by quotation marks, but a `{sleep}` and a `{clear}` command. Can you make it work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your story code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                    Mind: The variables in your own story should be outside of the quotation marks. Just like the second line of the example code. In that line the variable name is placed outside of the quotation marks.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} _ What is your name? _
                    {print}  _ The main character is called _ name
                    _
                    _
                    {print} name  _ is now going to walk in the woods _
                    {print} name _ is a bit scared _
                    animals {is} ü¶î, üêø, ü¶â, ü¶á
                    {print} _ He hears the sound of a _ animals {at} {random}
                    {print} name _ is afraid this is a haunted forest _
                    ```

                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'

                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print} 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    {while} keys == 'lost'
                        location = {ask} 'Where do you want to look?'
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed'
                            {print} 'Here they are!'
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Nope they are not at the ' location
                    {print} 'Now you can enter the house!'

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!
                example_code_2: |

                    naam = {input}("What's your name?")
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?
                    {remove} dislike {from} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}

                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'BLACKJACK'

                    # Set these variables
                    cards = _
                    face_cards = _
                    card_1 =

                    # Create a function to calculate the points
                    {define} calculate_points {with} card:
                        {if} card {in} face_cards:
                            points = _
                        {elif} _

                        _ points

                    # Test your function
                    {print} 'Your card is a ' _
                    {print} 'That is worth ' _ ' points'.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next tab***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next tab to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.

                    In the previous tabs you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***
                    Does your game work properly? Amazing! You have done a great job! Enjoy your game!

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks. We want this program to ask the player these questions:
                    ```
                    How much is 1 times 1?
                    How much is 1 times 2?

                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.

                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next tab!**

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question if they answer incorrectly.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the `{while}` loop in the function, ask the player what number_1 times number_2 is and print their answer.
                    Then `{call}` the function.

                        number_2 = numbers {at} {random}

                    ### Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    And so on.

                    Congratulations! You've reached level 2. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes!
                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    So let's go to the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    **Warning! This code does not work!**
                    In Hedy commands will change sometimes. `{echo}` for example only works in level 1. In this level you'll learn a better way to echo answers back.
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want

                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = dog, cat, blobfish

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    ```
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 10:

                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to _
                        {call} turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song {with} place
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    {call} song {with} 'sea'
                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _
                    {print} 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                    Let's make functions the Pythons way! To define a function, we no longer use:

                    `{define} name_function {with} argument_1, argument_2:`

                    but we use:

                    `{def} name_function(argument_1, argument_2):`.


                    If you don't want to use arguments, you just leave the space between the parantheses empty.
                    To call a function, we don't need the `{call}` command anymore. You just type the name of the function.

                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This games continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake..?

                                if answer[i] == guess:
                                    guessed_letters[i] = guess
                            {print} _
                            {if} guessed_letters == _:
                                {print} _

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous tab and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.
                example_code: |

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    ## If... Else...
                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'

                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal
                    ```

                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```

                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'

                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    Type `{play}` followed by the note you want to play. The scale goes C-D-E-F-G-A-B.
                    As you can see there are 7 different letters, but we can play more than just 7 notes.
                    Type a number between 1 and 10 behind the letter to choose the scale, for example after B4 comes C5.
                    C1 is the lowest note you can play, C10 is the highest.

                    Use functions in your songs! As you can see in the example code, you can make a function for each line of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Once you've programmed the first three lines, all you have to do is call the functions in the order you want them played in.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the song of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
                    Then look back at all the songs you've programmed in the levels before, can you make those codes better and shorter using functions too?

                    You can use a function with an argument for songs that have line that are almost the same, but slightly different each time.
                    One example is the song 'Yankee Doodle'. The first 4 notes of the first lines are the same, but each time they are followed by a different couple of notes.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you finish the song of Yankee Doodle?
                    Can you think of another song to program this way?

                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.

                    ### Exercise
                    The code you have seen in level 5 only checks the key once. Copy the example code and add a `{repeat}` to it, so that you can press the keys many times.
                    Use this code to draw something nice.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.

                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be run.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code. The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ``` Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else} {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Make 2 lists

                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous level here. Don't forget to remove the part that was just used for testing the functions.

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next tab, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next tab to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next tab.

                    In this tab we'll program the game of Simon Says!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    In this level you can easily make the childrens' song 'Five little monkeys'. Can you make the last chorus?
                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!
                    Or you can make Old MacDonald with all the different animals.
                example_code: |

                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    ### Exercise

                    In level 16 we made songs using lists. These programs however are no longer working properly in this level. The colons from level 17 and the brackets from level 18 still need to be added.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    Let's program a game of tic-tac-toe!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we'll start with creating an empty field.

                    ***Create a list called field*** This list will be our playing field. This list is filled with 9 dots, since there are no x's and o's yet at the start of our game.

                    ***Create a function that prints the field*** Firstly, clear the screen so the old playing fields will be removed. Then we print the first line of our Tic Tac Toe field. This line constists of the first 3 spots in our list field.
                    We have already programmed this line for you. Now finish the field by printing spot 4, 5, and 6 on the second row and spot 7, 8 and 9 in the third row.

                    ***Call the function that prints the field*** Now call the function.
                    <div class="w-full flex flex-row gap-2">
                        Run the code. Your output should look like this: <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/bcbd156e-4b48-4e82-84ae-f86d21b0cbcc" width="100">
                    </div>

                    ***Continue in the next tab*** In the next tab you'll learn how to program the game itself.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Create a list called field
                    _ = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

                    # Create a function that prints the field
                    {define} print_field
                        _
                        {print} 'TIC TAC TOE'
                        {print} field[1] field[2] field[3]
                        _
                        _

                    # Call the function
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In the previous level you've learned how to make a tic-tac-toe game. The game works, but is quite annoying as it keeps asking you if you've won yet.
                    Now that we have the {elif} command, we can let the game decide if someone has won and it can stop asking us!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Paste your code from the previous level here and make it level 17 proof. In this level you've learned to use a colon everytime you create a block of code. Please add the colons in the correct spots.

                    ***Create a function that detects if someone's won*** We have started the function for you, paste it under the function `print_field` and finish the function. You can see that this first piece of code checks to see if spot 1, 2 and 3 are the same, because if they are you have 3 in a row.
                    It also checks if they are not a dot, because if they are, the line might have the same symbols on them, but that's just because it's still empty.
                    If all these conditions are met, the game is over and the winner is printed.
                    Finish this function with all possible ways to win. This means you have to make this for the other 2 rows, 3 columns and 2 diagonals.
                    If you've finished all the other options, the function should return the variable `game_over` so we can use it in our game.

                    ***Call the function in the game*** Go to the line `game_over = {ask} 'Did you win?'` and change it to `game_over = {call} detect_winner {with} field, sign`. Now the function will check if there's a winner and the game doesn't need to keep asking anymore!

                    ***Enjoy your game!*** Great job! You have finished the game! Enjoy playing it!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code here and make it level 17 proof

                    # Create a function that detects if someone has won
                    {define} detect_winner {with} field, sign:
                        {if} field[1] == field[2] {and} field[2] == field[3] {and} field[1] != '.':
                            game_over = 'yes'
                            {print} 'Player ' sign 'wins!'
                        {elif}:
                            _
                        {else}:
                            game_over = 'no'
                    {return} _

                    In the previous adventure you've learned how to create a playing field. Now you'll learn how to create the game!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Start by pasting your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Add variables*** Underneath your list called `field` we'll add 2 more variables that we'll need to program the game.
                    The variable `game_over` tells us if the game is over, and should be 'no' at the start of the game.
                    The variable `sign` tells us if it's the turn of player x or player o. Set the variable to 'x'.

                    ***The game*** First use a {while} command, to make sure the game keeps on playing the variable while game_over is set to no.
                    During the game, we first ask the player which spot they choose. Then we change the field with the number they chose into their sign.
                    Then we print the field again and we ask the player if they've won yet. Lastly we want to switch whose turn it is, so if the sign is 'x' it should be 'o' and the other way around.

                    ***Test your game*** Does your game work? Great, have fun playing the game! If not, use the ladybug button to debug your code.
                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code though, you can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! Go to the next tab to learn how to fix this problem.

                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    # Add variables
                    game_over = _
                    sign = _

                    # The game
                    {while} _
                        choice = _ 'Player ' sign '_?'
                        field[choice] = _
                        _ print_field
                        game_over = {ask} _
                        {if} sign = 'o'
                            sign = _
                        _
                            sign = _

                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code you've made in the previous adventure. You can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! In this tab we'll fix that mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Fix the mistake*** To fix the mistake we replace the line that says `field[choice] = sign`. This turns any spot that the player has chosen into their sign.
                    Go to the header that says 'Use this to fix the mistake' and finish the code. We first want to check if the chosen spot is still empty, so `if field[choice] = '.'`. If that is the case, you are allowed to take it.
                    Then we make an else command and print 'Sorry, this spot is already taken' if the spot is not empty. Lastly, we add a {sleep} command, so the players can actually read the text before it gets cleared again.
                    Now copy this piece of code and replace the line `field[choice] = sign` with this new piece of code.

                    ***Play your game!*** Now the game should work properly! Good job!
                    The only flaw is that you can get a bit annoyed that the game keeps asking you if you've won yet. Do you want to fix that? Go to level 17 and we'll fix it!

                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2

                    We can use functions to draw more complex figures with less code.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill the function so that three squares are created. If you want the image to look nicer, you can make the lines between the squares white.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The code can be made even shorter. Place the final lines into a `{repeat}` so the figure remains the same.

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Create your own drawing with different figures.
                    Change both the number of figures with the `{repeat}` and the shape of the figures in the `{define}`

                    ### Exercise
                    Create a program that asks the player how many corners their figure should have and then creates that figure.
                    The figure in the image is the output when the player fills in 10.

                    Star
                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    In this level you can use the `{for} i {in} {range}` command to countdown to the New Year.

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work!
