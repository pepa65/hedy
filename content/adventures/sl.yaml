                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next tab!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next tab***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next tab to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.

                    {print} 'The dealer has drawn a ' _ ' and a ' _ '. That is ' _ ' points'

                    In the previous tabs you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    # Extra card for you
                    hit = {ask} _
                    {if} hit == 'yes':
                        card_3 = _
                        {print} _
                        {if} card_3 _ 'Ace':
                            your_points_3 = _
                            your_total = _
                        {else}:
                           {if} your_total _
                                _
                            {else}:
                                _
                        {print} _

                    # Extra card for the dealer
                    {if} dealer_total < 17
                    _

                    In the last 3 adventures you have alsmost created a working blackjack game! The only thing left to do is to decide a winner!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***
                    Does your game work properly? Amazing! You have done a great job! Enjoy your game!
                    If it doesn't work right away, no worries, you might have made a mistake. Just keep calm and bebug your code using the ladybug button.

Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.\nTo create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.\nLeave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!\n\nNow, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.\n\nCheck out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.\n\n### Exercise\nFinish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.\nThen, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.\n\n### Exercise 2\nImprove your code by adding a variable called 'people'.

                    In this adventure we program a game of hangman. First we make some preparations, then we program the game and in the third part we add a drawing with the turtle.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Set the variables*** In this game of hangman, Player 1 chooses an answer and Player 2 has to guess the letters in this answer.
                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Hangman!'

                    # Set the variables
                    answer = []
                    guessed_letters = _
                    mistakes_made = _
                    amount_letters = {ask} _
                    _ = 'False'

                    # Choosing the answer
                    {for} _
                        letter = {ask} 'Player 1, what is letter ' i '?'
                        _
                        {add} '_' {to} _

                    # Player 2 turn
                    print _
                    print _
                    print guessed_letters

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This games continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake..?

                                if answer[i] == guess:
                                    guessed_letters[i] = guess
                            {print} _

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous tab and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous level here. Don't forget to remove the part that was just used for testing the functions.

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next tab, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next tab to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next tab.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    Let's program a game of tic-tac-toe!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we'll start with creating an empty field.

                    ***Create a list called field*** This list will be our playing field. This list is filled with 9 dots, since there are no x's and o's yet at the start of our game.

                    ***Create a function that prints the field*** Firstly, clear the screen so the old playing fields will be removed. Then we print the first line of our Tic Tac Toe field. This line constists of the first 3 spots in our list field.
                    We have already programmed this line for you. Now finish the field by printing spot 4, 5, and 6 on the second row and spot 7, 8 and 9 in the third row.

                    ***Call the function that prints the field*** Now call the function.
                    <div class="w-full flex flex-row gap-2">
                        Run the code. Your output should look like this: <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/bcbd156e-4b48-4e82-84ae-f86d21b0cbcc" width="100">
                    </div>

                    ***Continue in the next tab*** In the next tab you'll learn how to program the game itself.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Create a list called field
                    _ = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

                    # Create a function that prints the field
                    {define} print_field
                        _
                        {print} 'TIC TAC TOE'
                        {print} field[1] field[2] field[3]
                        _
                        _

                    # Call the function
                    ```

                    In the previous level you've learned how to make a tic-tac-toe game. The game works, but is quite annoying as it keeps asking you if you've won yet.
                    Now that we have the {elif} command, we can let the game decide if someone has won and it can stop asking us!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Paste your code from the previous level here and make it level 17 proof. In this level you've learned to use a colon everytime you create a block of code. Please add the colons in the correct spots.

                    ***Create a function that detects if someone's won*** We have started the function for you, paste it under the function `print_field` and finish the function. You can see that this first piece of code checks to see if spot 1, 2 and 3 are the same, because if they are you have 3 in a row.
                    It also checks if they are not a dot, because if they are, the line might have the same symbols on them, but that's just because it's still empty.
                    If all these conditions are met, the game is over and the winner is printed.
                    Finish this function with all possible ways to win. This means you have to make this for the other 2 rows, 3 columns and 2 diagonals.
                    If you've finished all the other options, the function should return the variable `game_over` so we can use it in our game.

                    ***Call the function in the game*** Go to the line `game_over = {ask} 'Did you win?'` and change it to `game_over = {call} detect_winner {with} field, sign`. Now the function will check if there's a winner and the game doesn't need to keep asking anymore!

                    ***Enjoy your game!*** Great job! You have finished the game! Enjoy playing it!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code here and make it level 17 proof

                    # Create a function that detects if someone has won
                    {define} detect_winner {with} field, sign:
                        {if} field[1] == field[2] {and} field[2] == field[3] {and} field[1] != '.':
                            game_over = 'yes'
                            {print} 'Player ' sign 'wins!'
                        {elif}:
                            _
                        {else}:
                            game_over = 'no'
                    {return} _
                    ```

                    In the previous adventure you've learned how to create a playing field. Now you'll learn how to create the game!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Start by pasting your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Add variables*** Underneath your list called `field` we'll add 2 more variables that we'll need to program the game.
                    The variable `game_over` tells us if the game is over, and should be 'no' at the start of the game.
                    The variable `sign` tells us if it's the turn of player x or player o. Set the variable to 'x'.

                    ***The game*** First use a {while} command, to make sure the game keeps on playing the variable while game_over is set to no.
                    During the game, we first ask the player which spot they choose. Then we change the field with the number they chose into their sign.
                    Then we print the field again and we ask the player if they've won yet. Lastly we want to switch whose turn it is, so if the sign is 'x' it should be 'o' and the other way around.

                    ***Test your game*** Does your game work? Great, have fun playing the game! If not, use the ladybug button to debug your code.
                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code though, you can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! Go to the next tab to learn how to fix this problem.
                example_code: |

                    # Paste your code from the previous adventure here

                    # Add variables
                    game_over = _
                    sign = _

                    # The game
                    {while} _
                        choice = _ 'Player ' sign '_?'
                        field[choice] = _
                        _ print_field
                        game_over = {ask} _
                        {if} sign = 'o'
                            sign = _
                        _
                            sign = _

                    That's not fair! In this tab we'll fix that mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Fix the mistake*** To fix the mistake we replace the line that says `field[choice] = sign`. This turns any spot that the player has chosen into their sign.
                    Go to the header that says 'Use this to fix the mistake' and finish the code. We first want to check if the chosen spot is still empty, so `if field[choice] = '.'`. If that is the case, you are allowed to take it.
                    Then we make an else command and print 'Sorry, this spot is already taken' if the spot is not empty. Lastly, we add a {sleep} command, so the players can actually read the text before it gets cleared again.
                    Now copy this piece of code and replace the line `field[choice] = sign` with this new piece of code.

                    ***Play your game!*** Now the game should work properly! Good job!
                    The only flaw is that you can get a bit annoyed that the game keeps asking you if you've won yet. Do you want to fix that? Go to level 17 and we'll fix it!
