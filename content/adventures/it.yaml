                    Nel livello 1 puoi creare una storia con un personaggio principale diverso che inserisci tu stesso.

                    Nella prima riga, usa `{ask}` e chiedi chi sar√† il personaggio principale della storia.

                    Dopo la prima riga, inizia con `{print}`  se la frase deve essere stampata.
                    Usa `{echo}`  se vuoi che il tuo personaggio principale sia alla fine della frase.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} Il personaggio principale di questa storia √®
                    {print} Il personaggio principale ora camminer√† nella foresta
                    {echo} √à un po' spaventato,
                    {print} Sente rumori assurdi ovunque
                    {print} Ha paura che questa sia una foresta infestata
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Esercizio
                    Ora crea la tua storia di almeno 6 righe di codice.
                    Questa storia non pu√≤ essere uguale al codice di esempio.
                    Utilizza almeno un comando `{ask}` e un comando `{echo}`.
                    Puoi farlo su qualsiasi argomento che ti piace.
                    Se non riesci a pensare a un argomento, usa una delle nostre scelte: andare al cinema, una partita sportiva o una giornata allo zoo.

                story_text: |
                    Nel livello 2 puoi rendere la tua storia pi√π divertente. Il nome del tuo personaggio principale ora pu√≤ essere ovunque nella frase.

                    Devi programmare un po' di pi√π per quello. Ora devi prima nominare il tuo personaggio principale.

                    Puoi quindi inserire quel nome ovunque in una frase.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} What is the name of the main character?
                    {print} name is now going to run in the woods
                    {print} name is a bit scared
                    {print} Suddenly she hears a crazy noise...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Esercizio
                    Ora √® il momento di aggiungere variabili alla tua storia che hai creato nel livello precedente.
                    Vai su 'I miei programmi', cerca la tua avventura storia di livello 1 e copia il codice. Incolla il codice nella schermata di input in questo livello.

                    Questo codice non funzioner√† in questo livello perch√© non hai ancora utilizzato le variabili.
                    Modifica i comandi `{ask}` e `{echo}` nel tuo codice nella forma corretta che hai imparato in questo livello.

                    **Extra** Aggiungi un comando `{sleep}` al tuo codice per aumentare la tensione nella tua storia.
            3:
                story_text: |
                    Nel livello 3 puoi rendere la tua storia pi√π divertente. Puoi usare la casualit√† per qualsiasi mostro, animale o ostacolo, in questo modo:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} ü¶î, üêø, ü¶â, ü¶á
                    {print} They now hear the sound of an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} They hear a sound
                    animals {is} üêø, ü¶î, ü¶á, ü¶â
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was an animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    Questo √® un esempio del comando `{remove}` nella tua storia

                    ### Esercizio
                    Copia la tua storia dai livelli precedenti a questo livello.
                    In questo livello hai imparato 3 nuovi comandi `{at} {random}`, `{add} {to_list}` e `{remove} {from}`.
                    Aggiungi nuove righe di codice alla tua storia, in modo che tutti i nuovi comandi siano presenti almeno una volta nella tua storia.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} His backpack got way too heavy.
                    {print} Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag {is} water, flashlight, brick
                    dump {is} {ask} Which item should he dump?
                    {remove} dump {from} bag
                    ```
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ### Esercizio
                    Copia il codice di esempio e completalo aggiungendo virgolette sugli spazi vuoti nelle righe 1 e 2.
                    Gli spazi nelle righe 3 e 4 non devono essere sostituiti da virgolette, ma da un comando `{sleep}` e un comando `{clear}`. Puoi farlo funzionare?

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Torna al livello precedente e copia il codice della storia. Fai funzionare il codice in questo livello aggiungendo virgolette nei punti giusti.
                    Attenzione: le variabili nella tua storia dovrebbero essere fuori dalle virgolette. Proprio come la seconda riga del codice di esempio. In quella riga il nome della variabile viene inserito fuori dalle virgolette.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nome {is}{ask} _ Come ti chiami? _
                    {print} _ Il personaggio principale si chiama _ nome
                    _
                    _
                    {print} nome _ ora camminer√† nel bosco _
                    {print} nome _ √® un po' spaventato _
                    animali {is} ü¶î, üêø, ü¶â, ü¶á
                    {print} _ Sente il suono di _ animali {at} {random}
                    {print} nome _ ha paura che questa sia una foresta infestata _
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In questo livello puoi programmare diversi finali, che renderanno la tua storia ancora pi√π divertente.
                    Nel codice di esempio puoi vedere come realizzare 2 finali diversi.

                    ### Esercizio 1
                    Scrivi un nuovo racconto di almeno 6 righe di codice su un argomento di tua scelta.
                    Nessuna ispirazione? Scegli uno di questi argomenti: un supereroe, una noiosa giornata scolastica, bloccato su un'isola deserta.

                    Ora dai al giocatore la possibilit√† di scegliere una fine felice o cattiva, proprio come nel codice di esempio.
                    Programma entrambi i finali.

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Copia la storia che hai creato nella tua avventura narrativa nei livelli precedenti.
                    Trova un modo per aggiungere almeno 2 comandi `{if}` e `{else}` alla tua storia.
                    Questo pu√≤ avere un finale felice o brutto, ma puoi anche provare a trovare altri modi per incorporare i comandi.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nome {is} {ask} 'Chi sta camminando nella foresta?'
                    {print} nome 'cammina nella foresta'
                    {print} nome 'incontra un mostro'
                    fine {is} {ask} 'Vuoi un lieto fine o un brutto finale?'
                    {if} fine {is} lieto {print} nome 'prende la spada e il mostro scappa velocemente'
                    {else} {print} 'Il mostro mangia' nome
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In una storia, qualcuno dice le parole pi√π volte. Ad esempio, quando qualcuno chiede aiuto o canta una canzone.
                    Puoi inserire tali ripetizioni nella tua storia, in questo livello con `{repeat}`.

                    ### Esercizio
                    Aggiungi ripetizione alla tua storia. Torna ai programmi salvati, scegli il programma della storia dal livello precedente e
                    trova una riga contenente `{print}` e ripetila!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In questo livello puoi utilizzare pi√π righe nei comandi `{if}`, in questo modo puoi migliorare il tuo lieto fine o il tuo triste finale!

                    ### Esercizio 1
                    Il codice di esempio mostra due finali diversi; uno in cui i personaggi saltano in una macchina del tempo e uno in cui no.
                    Completa gli spazi vuoti con almeno una frase per conclusione.
                    **Extra** Rendi la storia pi√π lunga. Cosa succede nella storia? Puoi anche aggiungere un secondo `{ask}` con diverse opzioni.

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Torna ai tuoi programmi salvati, scegli il tuo programma storia dal livello 5. Ora scrivi un finale bello e uno brutto di almeno tre righe ciascuno!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! Il T-rex si sta avvicinando!'
                    end = {ask} 'Vuoi un finale felice o triste?'
                    {if} la fine {is} felice
                        {print} 'Appena in tempo Richard torna nella macchina del tempo!'
                        {print} _
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Oh no! Richard √® troppo lento...'
                        {print}_
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In questo livello puoi utilizzare i comandi `{if}` e `{repeat}` all'interno di altri comandi `{if}` e `{repeat}`.
                    Questo ti offre molte opzioni e ti aiuta davvero a rendere la tua storia interattiva.

                    ### Esercizio 1
                    Completa il codice in modo che `{if}` funzioni correttamente.

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Aggiungi un `{if}` e un `{else}` per la parte della storia in cui anche Robin torna a casa.

                    ### Esercizio 3
                    Torna alla tua storia di livello 8 e usa almeno due `{if}` all'interno di un altro `{if}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} "Robin sta camminando in centro"
                    location = {ask} 'Robin entra in un negozio o torna a casa?'
                    {if} luogo {is} negozio
                        {print} 'Lei entra nel negozio.'
                        {print} 'Robin vede un libro dall'aspetto interessante'
                        book = {ask} 'Robin compra il libro?'
                        {if}prenota{is} s√¨
                        _ {print} 'Robin compra il libro e torna a casa'
                        _{else}
                        _ {print} 'Robin esce dal negozio e torna a casa'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin va a casa'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In questo livello puoi usare il comando {for} nella tua storia. In questo modo potrete facilmente programmare il libro per bambini 'Orso bruno, Orso bruno, cosa vedi'.

                    ### Esercizio

                    Guarda <a href="https://www.yonkerspublicschools.org/cms/lib/NY01814060/Centricity/Domain/1621/Brown%20Bear%20Book.pdf"> la storia</a> se non la conosci e assicurati che sia stampato come nel libro.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animali = _ , _ , _
                    {print} 'Orso bruno, orso bruno'
                    {print} 'Cosa vedi?'
                    ```
            12:
                story_text: |-
                    In questo livello saranno necessarie le virgolette per salvare pi√π parole in una variabile.

                    ### Esercizio

                    Trova una storia da un livello precedente, qualsiasi livello √® ok. Ora assicurati che le virgolette siano aggiunte nei posti giusti.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly‚Ä¶'

                story_text: |
                    Utilizzando i comandi `{and}` e `{or}` puoi rendere le tue storie pi√π versatili. Puoi porre due domande e rispondere alla combinazione di risposte.

                    ### Esercizio 1
                    Guarda il codice di esempio e finiscilo. Quindi aggiungi almeno altri 2 codici `{if}` con `{and}` o `{or}`.

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Trova una storia di un livello precedente e aggiungi un `{and}` o `{or}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Il nostro eroe sta camminando attraverso la foresta'
                    {print} 'Il percorso si divide in due parti'
                    path = {ask} 'Quale percorso dovrebbe scegliere?'
                    arma = {ask} 'Che arma estrae?'
                    {if} percorso {is} 'sinistra' {and} arma {is} 'spada'
                        _

                story_text: |
                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continue the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise
                    The example code shows you how to use the `{while}` loop in a story. Now **think of your own scenario** in which the player has to find something before they can continue.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    {print} 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    {while} keys == 'lost'
                        location = {ask} 'Where do you want to look?'
                        {if} location == 'flowerbed'
                            {print} 'Here they are!'
                            keys = 'found'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Nope they are not at the ' location
                    {print} 'Now you can enter the house!'
                    ```

                    We are going to print another story, but now we have to use brackets with `{print}`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print}('Benvenuti in questa storia!')

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Abbiamo gi√† preparato un `{input}` per te. Innanzitutto, utilizza la variabile `name` nella tua storia.
                    Quindi aggiungi un secondo `{ask}` e usa anche quella variabile.
                    Suggerimento: ricorda le virgole in `{print}` tra testo e variabili!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    naam = {input}("Come ti chiami?")
                    {print}('Benvenuti in questa storia!')

                    L'asso vale 1 o 11 punti (puoi scegliere). Anche il dealer, il tuo avversario, riceve due carte.
                    Se lo desideri, puoi ottenere un'altra carta e i suoi punti verranno aggiunti al tuo totale. Il dealer pu√≤ anche scegliere di prendere un'altra carta.
                    Ma fai attenzione a non ottenere pi√π di 21 punti, perch√© se lo fai, perdi!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the first part of our Blackjack game. We'll create a function to calculate how many points a card is worth.

                    ***Set the variables***
                    Start by making a list of all the cards, from 2 to Ace. Next make a list of the face cards, so Jack, Queen and King. Then pick a random card from the list of cards to be card_1.

                    ***Create a function to calculate the points***
                    Create a function that calculates how many points a card is worth.
                    All the face cards are worth 10 points, the Ace is worth 11 and all the other cards are worth their numeral.
                    Return the variable `points` at the end of the function.

                    ***Test the function***
                    Test if your function is working properly. Finish the first print command by filling in which card you've drawn. Then finish the second line by calling the function with card_1.
                    Run the code a couple of times. Are you happy with the results? Great! Then you can remove the testing part and move on the the next tab!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'BLACKJACK'

                    # Set these variables
                    cards = _
                    face_cards = _
                    card_1 =

                    # Test your function
                    {print} 'Your card is a ' _
                    {print} 'That is worth ' _ ' points'.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we code the second part of our Blackjack game.

                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure***
                    In the previous adventure you've started a list of variables and created a function to calculate how many points a card is worth. Copy your code and paste it here. Mind that you don't need the testing part, so if you haven't removed that yet, please do so now.

                    ***Add more variables***
                    You have already set the lists `cards` and `face_cards` and the variable `card_1`. Underneath those variables create 3 more variables: `card_2`, dealer_card_1` and `dealer_card_2`. These variables are all set to a random card from the list of cards.

                    ***Add up points***
                    To calculate how many points you have scored we call the function with card 1 and we do it again for card 2. Then we add both these scores together to get your total.
                    Do the same thing for the dealers points, but be sure to use the dealer's cards and not your own!

                    ***2 Aces***
                    You're doing great! Almost all scores can be calculated now. There is only one exception: 2 Aces. If you get 2 Aces, your total is 12 points and not 22 (because 22 points would be losing!). This of course also goes for the dealer.

                    ***Show the score***
                    Lastly, you want to tell the program to tell you which cards you have drawn and how many points that is. Then show which cards the dealer has and how many points they have.

                    ***Continue in the next tab***
                    Great! You have finished this part of the game! Copy your code and go to the next tab to learn how to ask for an extra card and to declare a winner.

                    dealer_card_2 = _

                    # Add up your points
                    your_points_1 = {call} _ {with} card_1
                    your_points_2 = _
                    your_total = _

                    # Add up the dealers points

                    In the previous tabs you have learned how to draw 2 random cards for yourself and for the dealer and to calculate how many points you both got.
                    In this adventure we add the option to ask for an extra card for both you and the dealer.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Firstly, copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Extra card for you*** If you want, you can get an extra card to get your total as close to 21 as possible. First ask the player if they want an extra card.
                    If they do, pick a random card and print what they have drawn. If the card is not an Ace, you can call the function and add the points to your total.
                    In case the card is an Ace, you can't use the function, because the Ace can be either 1 point or 11 points, depending on how many points you already have earned.
                    If your total is less than 11, you want the ace to be 11 points (because this is closest to 21). So you add 11 points to your total.
                    If the total is more than or equal to 11, you want the ace to be 1 point (because you don't want more than 21 points). So you add 1 point to your total.
                    Lastly, print your new total of points.

                    ***Extra card for the dealer*** The dealer can also get an extra card. The dealer doesn't need to be asked, because they always get an extra card if their total is less than 17.
                    Copy the 'Extra card for you code' and paste it in the dealers section. Then change it to fit the dealer picking an extra card and getting points added to their total.

                    In the last 3 adventures you have alsmost created a working blackjack game! The only thing left to do is to decide a winner!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code from the previous adventure*** Start by pasting the code that you've made so far into your programming field.

                    ***Decide a winner***
                    Firstly, if you and the dealer have an equal amount of points, it's a draw.
                    Secondly, if the dealer has more than 21 points and you don't, you are the winner.
                    Thirdly, if both you and the dealer have less than 22 points, we have to see who came closest to 21. We do that by comparing who has the highest score. Is your total higher than the dealer's total, then you are the winner. If not, the dealer wins.
                    Lastly, in all other scenarios (e.g. you have more than 21 points and the dealer doesn't, or you both have more than 21 points) you are the loser.

                    ***Enjoy the game!***

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.

                    Compila gli spazi vuoti per completare la calcolatrice. Ricordarsi di utilizzare un punto e non una virgola per i numeri decimali.

                    ### Esercizio 2
                    Crea un nuovo programma di esercitazione di matematica, ma ora usa i numeri decimali.
                    Crea una lista di numeri, scegline due per multipli e lascia che sia il giocatore a rispondere.
                    E ovviamente devi convalidare la risposta! **Extra** Aumenta la difficolt√† aggiungendo vite: un giocatore perde una vita per una risposta sbagliata e dopo tre risposte sbagliate il gioco finisce.

                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the `{while}` loop in the function, ask the player what number_1 times number_2 is and print their answer.
                    Then `{call}` the function.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    Welcome to a debugging adventure. Debugging a code means getting rid of mistakes in the code.
                    That means that in these debugging adventures, we will give you a code that does not work yet.
                    You will have to figure out what's wrong and correct the mistakes.

                    ### Exercise
                    Debug this code. Good luck!

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Fr√®re Jaques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender

                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Benvenuto a Hedy! Nel Livello 1 puoi iniziare stampando un testo.

                    Prova tu stesso il codice! Il pulsante giallo copia il codice di esempio nel campo di programmazione.
                    Quindi premere il pulsante verde "Esegui codice" sotto il campo di programmazione per eseguire il codice.

                    Pronto? Quindi vai alla scheda successiva per scoprire come creare i tuoi codici!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Ciao Mondo!

                    Congratulazioni! Hai raggiunto il livello 2. Spero che tu abbia gi√† creato dei codici fantastici!
                    Nel primo livello potresti aver notato che il comando `{echo}` pu√≤ salvare solo un bit di informazione alla volta.
                    Ad esempio, nell'avventura del ristorante, potresti ripetere ci√≤ che il cliente voleva mangiare o ci√≤ che voleva bere, ma non entrambi in una frase.
                    Ci√≤ cambia nel livello 2. Nel livello 2 imparerai a lavorare con le variabili, che ti consentono di salvare pi√π informazioni e stamparle dove preferisci.
                    Quindi passiamo alla scheda successiva!
                example_code: |
                    **Avvertimento! Questo codice non funziona!**
                    In Hedy i comandi cambieranno a volte. `{echo}` ad esempio funziona solo nel livello 1. In questo livello imparerai un modo migliore per riprodurre le risposte.
                    ```
                    {print} Benvenuto da Hedy
                    {ask} Cosa vorresti mangiare?
                    {echo} Quindi vuoi
                    {ask} cosa vorresti bere?
                    {echo} Quindi vuoi
                    ```
            3:
                story_text: |
                    Nel livello precedente hai imparato cos'√® una variabile e come puoi usarla per rendere le tue avventure pi√π interattive.
                    Ma... non √® l'unica cosa che puoi fare con le variabili! Puoi anche utilizzare le variabili per creare elenchi.
                    E puoi anche lasciare che Hedy scelga una parola a caso da un elenco, cos√¨ potrai creare veri e propri giochi!
                    Dai una rapida occhiata alla scheda successiva!
            4:
                story_text: |
                    Nei livelli precedenti ti sei esercitato con le variabili, ma potresti aver riscontrato questo problema.
                    Potresti aver provato a eseguire un codice come questo:

                    Ovviamente volevi stampare

                    "Mi chiamo Sophie".

                    ma Hedy stampa

                    "La mia Sophie √® Sophie".

                    In questo livello questo problema viene risolto utilizzando le virgolette.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nome {is} Sophie
                    {print} Il mio nome √® nome
                    ```
            5:
                story_text: |
                    Nei livelli precedenti hai gi√† imparato a usare `{at} {random}` che rendeva i tuoi giochi diversi ogni volta che eseguivi il codice.
                    Ma non √® realmente interattivo, il giocatore non ha alcuna influenza su ci√≤ che accade nel gioco.

                    In questo livello imparerai il comando `{if}`, che ti permette di dare risposte diverse nel tuo programma. In questo modo puoi programmare ad esempio una password segreta per il tuo computer.
                    Quindi passiamo alla scheda successiva per il nuovo comando!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    password {is} {ask} 'Qual √® la password corretta?'
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    Nel livello precedente ti sei esercitato con `{ask}` e `{if}`. Ad esempio puoi chiedere agli ospiti cosa vorrebbero mangiare.
                    Quello che per√≤ non puoi ancora fare √® calcolare il prezzo della cena per tutti.

                    Il livello successivo rende possibile utilizzare addizioni, sottrazioni e moltiplicazioni nei tuoi programmi. In questo modo potrai calcolare i prezzi del tuo ristorante, ma potrai anche aggiungere un codice segreto per concedere uno sconto ai tuoi amici e familiari.
                    Un'altra opzione nel livello successivo √® programmare il tuo gioco di matematica, affinch√© il tuo fratellino o la tua sorellina possano esercitarsi con le moltiplicazioni.
                    Vai a vedere di persona!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    prezzo_cibo {is} 0
                    drink_price {is} 0

                    {if} ordina {is} patatine fritte food_price {is} 2
                    bere {is} {ask} 'Cosa vorresti bere?'

                    Ottimo lavoro! Hai raggiunto il livello successivo, il che significa che ti sei esercitato con `{if}`e `{else}`. Probabilmente hai notato che i tuoi codici diventano sempre pi√π lunghi.
                    Ad esempio se si desidera programmare 'Buon Compleanno'.

                    Si tratta di un sacco di codice che contiene principalmente le stesse parole pi√π e pi√π volte. Fortunatamente nella scheda successiva imparerai una soluzione con il comando `{repeat}`, che ti consente di ripetere una riga di codice pi√π volte.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'buon compleanno a te'
                    {print} 'buon compleanno a te'
                    {stampa} 'buon compleanno cara Hedy'
                    {print} 'buon compleanno a te'
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    `{ask}` e `{print}` funzionano ancora come prima. Ma `{if}`, `{else}`, {pressed} e `{repeat}` sono cambiati!
                    Ora puoi raggruppare pi√π righe insieme, ma dovrai *indentare* il codice.
                    Questo significa inserire quattro spazi all'inizio della riga. Devi indentare anche se vuoi creare un blocco con una sola riga.
                example_code: |
                    Il comando `{repeat}` ora funziona in questo modo:
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Ciao a tutti'
                        {print} 'Tutto questo viene ripetuto 5 volte'
                    ```
                    Mentre i comandi `{if}` e `{else}` ora funzionano in questo modo:

                    ```
                    nome {is} {ask} 'Come ti chiami?'
                    {if} nome {is} Hedy
                        {print} 'Ciao Hedy'
                        {print} 'Puoi giocare sul tuo computer!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'INTRUSO!'
                        {print} 'Non puoi usare questo computer!'

                    This calculator game helps you practise your tables of multiplication!
                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the blanks. We want this program to ask the player these questions:
                    ```
                    How much is 1 times 1?
                    How much is 1 times 2?
                    How much is 1 times 3?
                    How much is 2 times 1?
                    How much is 2 times 2?
                    How much is 2 times 3?
                    How much is 3 times 1?
                    How much is 3 times 2?
                    How much is 3 times 3?
                    _

                    Forse hai provato a utilizzare i numeri decimali nella tua avventura al ristorante. Se lo hai fatto, probabilmente avrai notato che Hedy non li capiva ancora e completava sempre.
                    Da questo livello in poi √® possibile utilizzare i numeri decimali.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Two and a half plus two and a half is...'

                    Nei livelli precedenti hai imparato come inserire due comandi `{if}`uno dentro l'altro. Funziona bene, ma ti d√† codici molto lunghi e scomodi come questo:

                    In questo sistema devi fornire sia il nome utente corretto che la password corretta.
                    In questo livello imparerai il comando `{and}` che render√† questo codice molto pi√π breve e comprensibile!
                    Controlla!
                example_code: |

                    Ora impareremo come usare dei nuovi elementi. Potresti gi√† conoscerli dalla matematica, il `<` e il `>`.
                    Il `<` controlla se il primo numero √® pi√π piccolo del secondo, per esempio et√† `<` 12 controlla se l'et√† √® minore di 12.
                    Se vuoi controllare se il primo numero √® pi√π piccolo o uguale al secondo, puoi usare il `<=`, per esempio et√† `<=` 11.
                    Il `>` controlla se il primo numero √® pi√π grande del secondo, per esempio punteggio `>` 10 controlla se il punteggio √® maggiore di 10.
                    Se vuoi controllare se il primo numero √® pi√π grande o uguale al secondo, puoi usare il `>=`, per esempio punteggio `>=` 11.
                    Questi confronti si usano dentro il comando `{if}`, in questo modo:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}

                    Ma il codice √® inefficace e troppo lungo. Inoltre, cosa succede se il giocatore vuole giocare a 101 giochi invece di 100?
                    Non puoi giocare all'infinito?

                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    Completa il codice di esempio in modo che il codice indichi "Puoi smettere di lanciare" una volta lanciato un lombrico. Dovrebbe essere scritto "Devi lanciare di nuovo" se hai lanciato qualcos'altro.
                    **Extra** Forse vuoi ricreare un dado di un gioco completamente diverso. Va bene anche quello! Quindi inventa la tua reazione, ad es. "s√¨" per 6 e "peccato" per qualcos'altro.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw {is} _

                    Potresti sapere che il verme conta 5 punti per i lombrichi. Ora dopo un lancio puoi immediatamente calcolare quanti punti hai lanciato.
                    Questo √® il codice per calcolare i punti per un dado:

                    ### Esercizio
                    Puoi creare il codice in modo da ottenere il punteggio totale per 8 dadi? Per fare ci√≤, devi tagliare e incollare alcune righe del codice.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code_2: |
                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `{repeat}` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm

                    In this level you can create a little game in which you'll have to throw 6 as fast as possible.
                    We have started the code, it's up to you to get the game to work!

                    Firstly, add a `{while}` loop that checks if 6 has been thrown or not.
                    As long as you haven't thrown 6 already, throw the dice on a random number.
                    Print what the player has thrown.
                    Add a try to the amount of tries
                    Wait a second before you throw again, or - in case you've thrown a 6 - before the game ends.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    options = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
                    {print} 'Throw 6 as fast as you can!'
                    thrown = 0

                    Con `{if}` ora puoi divertirti di pi√π con la scelta nel programma. Puoi fare in modo che il tuo programma risponda alla scelta fatta dal computer.
                    ### Esercizio
                    Puoi completare il codice in modo che venga stampato "peccato" quando tocca a te e altrimenti "s√¨!"?
                    Non dimenticare le virgolette!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher {is} people {at} {random}
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Sophie {print} _ too bad I have to do the dishes _ {else} {print} 'luckily no dishes because' _ 'is already washing up'
                    ```

                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    With the `{repeat}` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for the entire week.

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In questo livello aggiungiamo una nuova forma di `{for}`. Nei livelli precedenti usavamo `{for}` con un elenco, ma possiamo anche usare `{for}` con i numeri.
                    Lo facciamo aggiungendo un nome di variabile, seguito da `{in}` `{range}`. Scriviamo quindi il numero da cui iniziare, `{to}`e il numero da cui terminare.

                    Prova l'esempio per vedere cosa succede! Anche in questo livello, dovrai utilizzare i rientri nelle righe sotto le istruzioni `{for}`.

                    Siete mai stati a un carnevale e vi siete fatti predire il futuro da un'indovino? O hai mai giocato con una palla otto magica?
                    Allora probabilmente saprai che non possono davvero predire il tuo futuro, ma √® comunque divertente giocarci!

                    Nei prossimi livelli potrai imparare a creare la tua macchina per predire il futuro!
                    Nel livello 1 puoi iniziare in modo semplice lasciando che Hedy si presenti come un'indovino e lasci che `{echo}` le risposte dei giocatori.
                    Come questo:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is

                story_text_2: |
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                story_text: |
                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} I‚Äôm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...

                    {print} answers {at} {random}

                story_text_2: |
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your fortune teller code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.

                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'

                    In this level you'll learn how to use **functions**. A function is a block of code you can easily use multiple times. Using functions helps us organize pieces of code that we can use again and again.
                    To create a function, use `{define}` and give the function a name. Then put all the lines you want in the function in a indented block under the `{define}` line.
                    Leave one empty line in your code to make it look nice and neat. Great job! You have created a function!

                    Now, whenever we need that block of code, we just use <code>{call}</code> with the function's name to call it up! We don't have to type that block of code again.

                    Check out this example code of a game of Twister. The function 'turn' contains a block of code that chooses which limb should go where.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code by setting the 2 variables chosen_limb and chosen_color.
                    Then, choose how many times you want to call the function to give the twister spinner a spin.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Improve your code by adding a variable called 'people'. Use the variable to give all the players their own command in the game.
                    For example: 'Ahmed, right hand on green' or 'Jessica, left foot on yellow'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sides = 'left', 'right'
                    limbs = 'hand', 'foot'
                    colors = 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'

                    {define} turn
                        chosen_side = sides {at} {random}
                        chosen_limb = limbs _
                        chosen_color = colors _
                        {print} chosen_side ' ' chosen_limb ' on ' chosen_color

                    {print} 'Lets play a game of Twister!'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 to _
                        {call} turn
                        {sleep} 2
                    ```

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} song {with} place
                        {print} 'My Bonnie is over the ' place

                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    {call} song {with} 'sea'
                    {call} song {with} 'ocean'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _
                    {print} 'The new price is ' new_price ' dollar'
                    ```

                    Let's make functions the Pythons way! To define a function, we no longer use:

                    `{define} name_function {with} argument_1, argument_2:`

                    but we use:

                    `{def} name_function(argument_1, argument_2):`.


                    If you don't want to use arguments, you just leave the space between the parantheses empty.
                    To call a function, we don't need the `{call}` command anymore. You just type the name of the function.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {def} calculate_score(answer, correct_answer):

                    In this adventure we program a game of hangman. First we make some preparations, then we program the game and in the third part we add a drawing with the turtle.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Set the variables*** In this game of hangman, Player 1 chooses an answer and Player 2 has to guess the letters in this answer.
                    To let the computer know all the letters in the word, we will turn the answer into a list of letters. We also do this with the guesses Player 2 makes.
                    We will start the game with 2 empty lists. We have made an empty list for the variable answer for you. Now make an empty list for guessed_letters as well.
                    Then we fill in how many mistakes were made. At the start of the game, this should be 0.
                    The variable `amount_letters` tells us how many letters are in the answer. Ask Player 1 to tell us how many letters their word has.
                    Lastly we tell the computer if the game is over. We use the variable `game_over` and set it to `False`.

                    ***Choosing the answer*** We want Player 1 to be able to choose the answer. We'll ask them, as many times as necessary, what the next letter is.
                    Then we add that letter to the answer. Lastly, we add an empty _ to the list of guessed letters, so we get as many _s as there are letters in the answer.

                    ***Player 2's turn***
                    Tell Player 2 its their turn. Then tell Player 2 how many letters there are in the answer. Finally, print the list of `guessed_letters`.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Now that all the starting variables are set, we can start programming the game itself. Check out the next tab to learn how!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'Hangman!'

                    # Set the variables
                    answer = []
                    guessed_letters = _
                    mistakes_made = _
                    amount_letters = {ask} _
                    _ = 'False'

                    # Choosing the answer
                    {for} _
                        letter = {ask} 'Player 1, what is letter ' i '?'
                        _
                        {add} '_' {to} _

                    # Player 2 turn
                    print _
                    print _
                    print guessed_letters

                    Now it's time to program the hangman game.

                    ### Exercise

                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste the code in the programming field.

                    ***The game*** This games continues playing until Player 2 is game over. Fill in the while command accordingly. Now, Player 2 is allowed to guess a letter, so ask Player 2 to guess a letter.
                    We need to check if their answer is correct, so check if their `guess` is (somewhere) in the (list) `answer`. Then we let the computer figure out which of the letter(s) is the guess. We have already programmed that part for you.
                    Next we want to compliment the player for finding a correct letter and we want to print the list `guessed_letters`, so the player can see their progress.

                    The next part we're going to program is what happens when the player has guessed all of the letters. So if their list of `guessed_letters` is the same as our list `answer`.
                    If the lists are the same, congratulate Player 2 with their victory and set the variable `game_over` to `True`.

                    Next we'll program what happens when Player 2 guesses wrong (so the `{else}` command). First, tell the player that their guess was wrong. Then increase the `mistakes_made` variable by 1.

                    For the last part we'll program what happens when Player 2 has made 10 mistakes. We'll print that Player 1 has won the game. Then we'll print the correct answer. And finally, we'll set our `game_over` variable to `True`, so the game stops.

                    ***Go to the next tab*** Amazing work! Your game is playable, but wouldn't it be fun if the hangman was actually drawn when Player 2 makes a mistake..?

                    In a game of hangman the mistakes are shown by drawing a part of the hangman each time a mistake has been made.
                    We now add those drawings with our turtle!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Create a function that draws the hangman*** Create a function that draws the hangman in 10 steps. We have already made step 1 for you.

                    ***Test the function*** Test the function by calling the function with 10. If you are happy with the function, remove the line that calls the function for now. We will call the function when the player makes a mistake.

                    ***Paste your hangman game under your function*** Go back to the previous tab and copy your hangman game. Paste the game underneath your function.

                    ***Call the function when the player makes a mistake*** Under the line `mistakes_made = mistakes_made + 1` we will call the function. We want the turtle to take the same amount of steps as the player has made mistakes, so we call the function with `mistakes_made` as argument.

                    ***Enjoy your game!***

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but {if} not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and {ask} the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} How did I get here?
                    {print} I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
                    {print} and suddenly everything went black.
                    {print} But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    {print} My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    {print} What's that sound?
                    {print} Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    {print} I need to get out of here!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    {ask} Which door should i pick?
                    {echo} I choose door
                    {print} ...?
                    ```

                    In this haunted house you can choose your monsters with emojis. Of course you could also use words.

                    ```
                    monster_1 {is} üëª

                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster_3 attacks you!

                    In the example above the monsters are predetermined. So each time you run your code, the output is the same.
                    Can you add `{ask}` commands to make the haunted house interactive and have the players choose the monsters they come across?

                    monster_3 {is} _
                    {print} You enter the haunted house.
                    {print} Suddenly you see a monster_1
                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.
                    {print} But as you enter monster_3 attacks you!

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!
                example_code: |

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!

                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?

                    In the previous adventure you have learned how to use an argument in a function, and you've learned how to combine it with an {ask}.
                    You might have wondered why you would use functions, because the functions in the example were only one line of code.
                    Now we will show you what a bigger function looks like and we will use multiple agruments now as well. You'll see how much better it is to use a function once the function gets bigger.
                    Here is an example of a function with arguments combined with {ask} commands.

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:

                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old

                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animal`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animal {is} _
                    {print} I like favorite_animal

                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'
                    {else}

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    As you can see there are 7 different letters, but we can play more than just 7 notes.
                    Type a number between 1 and 10 behind the letter to choose the scale, for example after B4 comes C5.
                    C1 is the lowest note you can play, C10 is the highest.

                    With `{pressed}` you can use keys on your keyboard to control what lines are used.

                    ### Exercise
                    Look at the example and add one more line of code that reacts to a key press.

                    Copy the lines a few times so you can create a larger drawing.
                example_code_2: |

                    Use this code to draw something nice.
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    Now that you know how to combine statements, you can create a touch type tool with `{pressed}`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.

                    In questo esercizio vedrai uno spazio bianco rosa. Devi scrivere qualcosa al posto dello spazio rosa prima che il codice possa essere avviato.

                    Riempi il comando `{print}` nello spazio bianco e aggiungi cinque linee di codice aggiuntive. Ogni linea di codice deve iniziare con un comando `{print}`.

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    {print} 'We need to use ' answer
                    ```

                    ## Contractions
                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.
                    Check out the example code to see the wrong way of using apostrophes.

                    name = 'Hedy the Robot'

                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Black Widow'.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Black Widow'

                    ## At random
                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dogs, cats, kangaroos

                    We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.
                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code. The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    friends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']
                    {print} friends[1] ' is the first friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[2] ' is the second friend on the list.'
                    {print} friends[3] ' is the third friend on the list.'
                    #now we will match 2 lists using the variable i
                    lucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 3
                        {print} friends[i] 's lucky number is ' lucky_numbers[i]

                story_text_2: |-
                    Now that you've learned to use the brackets in lists, you can also start using the {at} {random} command in the Python way!

                    Level 7 adds the `{repeat}` command.  `{repeat}` can be used to execute one line of code multiple times. Like this:

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ``` Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.

                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you now?'
                    {repeat} age {times} {print} 'Hip Hip Hurray!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ### Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'
                    _ {repeat} 2 {times}
                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    Go back to the previous level and copy your restaurant code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots and add some `{clear}` commands.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Add the quotation marks to this code _
                    {print} Welcome to Restaurant Chez Hedy!
                    {print} Today we are serving pizza or lasagna.
                    food {is} {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {print} Great choice! The  food  is my favorite!
                    topping {is} {ask} Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                    {print} food  with  topping  is on its way!
                    drinks {is} {ask} What would you like to drink with that?
                    {print} Thank you for your order.
                    {print} Your  food  and  drinks  will be right there!
                    ```

                    In this level the {if} command allows you to {ask} your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                    In the example below, you see that you can {ask} the customer {if} they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'

                    drink {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink with that?'
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'Im sorry, we are out of cola!' {else} {print} 'Great choice!'
                    anything {is} {ask} 'Would you like anything {else}?'
                    {print} 'Let me repeat your order...'
                    {print} 'One ' food
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'and...' {else} {print} 'One ' drink
                    {if} anything {is} no {print} 'Thats it!' {else} {print} 'One ' anything
                    {print} 'Thank you for your order and enjoy your meal!'

                    {print} 'Welcome to Restaurant Chez Hedy'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                story_text: |
                    In this level you've learned how to use the {repeat} command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to {ask} multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'

                    Let's make a game of Simon Says! Simon Says is a memory game in which the player will be given a color. They have to repeat that color back.
                    If they get it right a color is added to the sequence, so they now have to remember 2 colors, then 3, then 4 etc. the game stops as soon as the player makes a mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    In this first part of the Simon Says adventure, we'll let the computer pick a random color and add it to a list.

                    ***Make 2 lists*** First, make a list called `colors` and fill it with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
                    Then make a list called `simon_sequence`. This list will be used as the answer.
                    At the start of the game this lists need to be empty. unfortunately, we can't create an empty list (yet), so we'll fill it with the words 'empty' and 'list' and we'll remove them from the list immediately.

                    ***Create a function that adds a color to the sequence*** Now that we have an empty list called simon_sequence, we can start filling it with random colors.
                    We do that with a function, so we can call it everytime there's a new level in our game. Create a function called `add_random_color`.
                    Then create the variable random_color and set it to a random color. Next, add this random color to the simon_sequence.

                    ***Create a function that shows the simon_sequence*** Start by naming the new function `show_simon_sequence` with `level` as an argument. Now we want to show as many colors as the level we are in (in level 1 you see 1 color, in level 2 you see 2 colors etc).
                    So we repeat `level` times, to print the `simon_sequence[i]`. Each time a color is shown, wait for 1 second and then clear the screen.

                    ***Test your program*** Before you go to the next level, test if the functions are working by calling both of the functions. If they're working you should see a random color in your output screen.
                    Remove this testing part of your code, copy the code and continue to the next tab to learn more about the simon says game!
                example_code: |
                    ```

                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous level here. Don't forget to remove the part that was just used for testing the functions.

                    ***Create a function that creates the player_sequence*** The list `player_sequence` is used to capture the answers of the player. First we define the function with the argument level.
                    Next, we ask level times what the color is that they choose. We call that variable `answer`. Then we add the variable `answer` to the list player_sequence.

                    ***Setting up the game*** Before we program the game in the next tab, we'll need some starting variables. First, we'll set the variable `level` to 1 and the variable `game_over` to False.
                    Then we make an introduction for the game. We'll print 'Welcome to Simon Says!' and clear the screen after 1 second.

                    ***Continue to the next tab to finish the game!**** Don't forget to copy your code and take it with you to the next tab.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Copy your code from the previous tab and paste it here.

                    ***Program the game*** We start by making sure the game goes on while the game isn't over. Then we print what level the player is on, we use the variable level for that. We only show that for 1 second and then we clear the screen again.
                    Now, we have to create the empty list player_sequence. We've already programmed how to fill the list, with our function `player_sequence`, but we never made the list itself. To create the list we use the same trick as we did in the previous tab.
                    We'll make a list with the words 'empty' and 'list' on it, and then we remove both these words. Next, we'll call all of the 3 functions that we've created.
                    Lastly, we'll have to check if the player gave the correct answers (so if the player_sequence and the simon_sequence are the same).
                    If that's the case, we'll compliment the player. Wait for 1 second and increase the level with 1.
                    Did the player give the wrong answer, we'll tell them and end the game by setting game_over to 'True'

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verso = 99
                    _ 99 {times}
                    {print} versetto 'bottiglie di birra sul muro'
                    {print} versetto 'bottiglie di birra'
                    {print} 'Prendine uno e passalo in giro'
                    verso = verso - 1
                    {print} versetto 'bottiglie di birra sul muro'

                    In this level you can easily make the childrens' song 'Five little monkeys'. Can you make the last chorus?
                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!
                    Or you can make Old MacDonald with all the different animals.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    famiglia = bambino, mamma, pap√†, nonna, nonno

                    Print the song Five little moneys jumping on the bed. Look up the text if you don't remember.

                    **(extra)** Print the song Old MacDonald had a farm, and make sure all animals make a different sound, using an `{if}`.

                    In this song we can make it even easier to program 'if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands'. Because we can put all of the actions in a variable, check it out:

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you add the right amount of indentation to each line to make the song play correctly?
                    Hint: Not all lines need indentation.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ actions = 'clap your hands', 'stomp your feet', 'shout Hurray!'
                    _ {for} action {in} actions
                    _ {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 2
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it'
                    _ {print} action
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'

                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    ### Exercise
                    Complete the Old MacDonald song by setting the variable `animal` to `animals[i]` and `sound` to `sounds[i]`.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    Let's program a game of tic-tac-toe!

                    ### Exercise
                    In this adventure we'll start with creating an empty field.

                    ***Create a list called field*** This list will be our playing field. This list is filled with 9 dots, since there are no x's and o's yet at the start of our game.

                    ***Create a function that prints the field*** Firstly, clear the screen so the old playing fields will be removed. Then we print the first line of our Tic Tac Toe field. This line constists of the first 3 spots in our list field.
                    We have already programmed this line for you. Now finish the field by printing spot 4, 5, and 6 on the second row and spot 7, 8 and 9 in the third row.

                    ***Call the function that prints the field*** Now call the function.
                    <div class="w-full flex flex-row gap-2">
                        Run the code. Your output should look like this: <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/bcbd156e-4b48-4e82-84ae-f86d21b0cbcc" width="100">
                    </div>

                    ***Continue in the next tab*** In the next tab you'll learn how to program the game itself.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Create a list called field
                    _ = ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

                    # Create a function that prints the field
                    {define} print_field
                        _
                        {print} 'TIC TAC TOE'
                        {print} field[1] field[2] field[3]
                        _
                        _

                    # Call the function
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In the previous level you've learned how to make a tic-tac-toe game. The game works, but is quite annoying as it keeps asking you if you've won yet.
                    Now that we have the {elif} command, we can let the game decide if someone has won and it can stop asking us!

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code*** Paste your code from the previous level here and make it level 17 proof. In this level you've learned to use a colon everytime you create a block of code. Please add the colons in the correct spots.

                    ***Create a function that detects if someone's won*** We have started the function for you, paste it under the function `print_field` and finish the function. You can see that this first piece of code checks to see if spot 1, 2 and 3 are the same, because if they are you have 3 in a row.
                    It also checks if they are not a dot, because if they are, the line might have the same symbols on them, but that's just because it's still empty.
                    If all these conditions are met, the game is over and the winner is printed.
                    Finish this function with all possible ways to win. This means you have to make this for the other 2 rows, 3 columns and 2 diagonals.
                    If you've finished all the other options, the function should return the variable `game_over` so we can use it in our game.

                    ***Call the function in the game*** Go to the line `game_over = {ask} 'Did you win?'` and change it to `game_over = {call} detect_winner {with} field, sign`. Now the function will check if there's a winner and the game doesn't need to keep asking anymore!

                    ***Enjoy your game!*** Great job! You have finished the game! Enjoy playing it!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    # Paste your code here and make it level 17 proof

                    The variable `sign` tells us if it's the turn of player x or player o. Set the variable to 'x'.

                    ***The game*** First use a {while} command, to make sure the game keeps on playing the variable while game_over is set to no.
                    During the game, we first ask the player which spot they choose. Then we change the field with the number they chose into their sign.
                    Then we print the field again and we ask the player if they've won yet. Lastly we want to switch whose turn it is, so if the sign is 'x' it should be 'o' and the other way around.

                    ***Test your game*** Does your game work? Great, have fun playing the game! If not, use the ladybug button to debug your code.
                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code though, you can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! Go to the next tab to learn how to fix this problem.

                    You might have noticed one mistake in the code you've made in the previous adventure. You can steal the other player's spot! If the other person chose spot 1, you could simply enter 1 after them and steal their spot.
                    That's not fair! In this tab we'll fix that mistake.

                    ### Exercise
                    ***Paste your code here*** Paste your code from the previous adventure here.

                    ***Fix the mistake*** To fix the mistake we replace the line that says `field[choice] = sign`. This turns any spot that the player has chosen into their sign.
                    Go to the header that says 'Use this to fix the mistake' and finish the code. We first want to check if the chosen spot is still empty, so `if field[choice] = '.'`. If that is the case, you are allowed to take it.
                    Then we make an else command and print 'Sorry, this spot is already taken' if the spot is not empty. Lastly, we add a {sleep} command, so the players can actually read the text before it gets cleared again.
                    Now copy this piece of code and replace the line `field[choice] = sign` with this new piece of code.

                    ***Play your game!*** Now the game should work properly! Good job!
                    The only flaw is that you can get a bit annoyed that the game keeps asking you if you've won yet. Do you want to fix that? Go to level 17 and we'll fix it!

                    ```
                    # Paste your code here

                    {if} _ = '.'
                        field[choice] = sign

                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.
                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 100

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Drawing figures

                    In questo livello puoi usare `{at} {random}` con la tartaruga che disegna. Una scelta casuale fa s√¨ che la tartaruga percorra ogni volta un percorso diverso.
                    Utilizza `{at} {random}` per scegliere un valore da un elenco.
                    ### Esercizio
                    Puoi copiare e incollare le righe 2 e 3 per creare un percorso casuale pi√π lungo?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles {is} 10, 50, 90, 150, 250

                    ```
                    {print} 'Drawing figures'

                story_text_2: |
                    You can also change the color of the lines with the command `{color}`. Check out the example.
                    You can also use the command `{color} {white}` to make 'invisible' lines. You could use these white lines to move the turtle anywhere in the screen before you start drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {color} {white}
                    {forward} -80
                    {color} {green}

                    ### Exercise
                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    direction {is} {ask} 'Do you want to go left, right, or straight ahead?'
                    if direction is left turn _
                    if direction is right turn _
                    forward 100
                    ```
            6:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle
                    ```
            8:
                story_text: |
                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angle = 90
                    {repeat} 10 {times}
                        {turn} angle
                        {forward} 50
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, we can now improve the program that draws different figures.
                    Can you figure out how far the turtle has to turn here? Finish the code and you can draw any polygon you'd like!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    figure = {ask} 'How many angles should I draw?'
                    angle = 360 / figure
                    {repeat} figure {times}
                        {turn} _
                        {forward} _
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    Now that we can use a `{repeat}` inside a `{repeat}`, we can create more complex figures.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    This code creates three black triangles, change that into five pink squares.

                     **(extra)** Create a figure of your own choosing consisting of at least two different shapes types.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {color} {black}
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        {repeat} 3 {times}
                            {forward} 10
                            {turn} 120
                        {color} {white}
                        {forward} 50
                        {color} {black}

            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {turn} 90
                    distances = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
                    {for} distance {in} distances
                        {forward} distance
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    We can use functions to draw more complex figures with less code.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill the function so that three squares are created. If you want the image to look nicer, you can make the lines between the squares white.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The code can be made even shorter. Place the final lines into a `{repeat}` so the figure remains the same.

                    ### Exercise 3
                    Create your own drawing with different figures.
                    Change both the number of figures with the `{repeat}` and the shape of the figures in the `{define}`
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} square

                    ### Exercise
                    Create a program that asks the player how many corners their figure should have and then creates that figure.
                    The figure in the image is the output when the player fills in 10.

                    A star is usually drawn using 144-degree-turns. If you change this slightly to 143 degrees for example and repeat the pattern multiple times with a {while} loop you can make this figure.
